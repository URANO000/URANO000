# Hello! I'm Adriana, a Software Engineering student in Costa Rica!
## About me: 
- I currently am learning a bit of everything in university. The main language I can handle is Java, though I can make things work with JS, CSS and HTML (PHP here and there)
- Currently, I am trying to learn a bit more of full stack development.
- Someday, I might actually know stuff, for now- who knows.
